We have developed a program that solves the a 3x3x3 Rubiks cube

A Rubik's Cube algorithm is an operation on the puzzle which reorients its pieces in a certain way. Mathematically the Rubik's Cube is a permutation group: an ordered list, with 54 fields with 6*9 values (colours) on which we can apply operations (basic face rotations, cube turns and the combinations of these) which reorient the permutation group according to a pattern.
